//Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
var Book = {
    title: "The hobbit ",
    author: "J.R.R Tolkien",
    yearpublish: 1937,
};
console.log("Book Info: ".concat(Book.title, "by ").concat(Book.author, ",publish in ").concat(Book.yearpublish));
