//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let transport: string[] = ["Honda", "Tesla", "Bicycle"];
transport.forEach((transport) => {
  console.log(`I whould like to own a ${transport}.`);
});
=======
//Arrays help you group related items, like types of transportation. This way, you can talk about each one using a loop.

let transports: string[] = ["Honda motorcycle", "Tesla car", "Bianchi bicycle"];

transports.forEach(transport => {
    console.log(`I would like to own a ${transport}.`);
});
